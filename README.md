# Moodle Local Barecrumbs

This plugin alters the breadcrumb navigation. Any category breadcrumb that links to a hidden category is changed to plain text. This does not apply to users who have permission to see hidden categories.

This allows users to have a smoother navigation expierience -- they will be able to use the breadcrumbs to see where they are (for example, "Fall 2018"), but will not end up clicking through and getting an access error.
